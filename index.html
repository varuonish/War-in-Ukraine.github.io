				<h3>24/02/22</h3>
				<p>
					When it all began, civilians were peacefully sleeping, but at 4 in the morning, something terrible happened. Outcries shattered the stillness, and from that moment on, restful sleep became a distant memory. People started fleeing, abandoning their homes, leaving behind family, work, and loved ones. In just one day, everything in my life changed, and it's terrifying to realize the value of life only after losing everything you once had. I was born and raised in Kharkiv, and now my hometown lies in ruins. People are fighting for their lives, and friends are perishing. Young men are on the front lines, fathers are leaving their children behind to defend the country.

		<h3>Currently</h3>
		<p>
			Today, an increasing number of people are losing their lives, and more individuals are forced to migrate as corruption runs rampant. Many politicians prioritize personal benefits, neglecting the needs of the people. The resources for daily living are dwindling, the military strength is diminishing, and hope is fading. The situation in Ukraine has worsened considerably, yet it seems to be fading from the collective consciousness. I can't blame anyone; those living under peaceful skies may struggle to comprehend the devastation that occurs when one's life is torn apart. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone. These paragraphs serve as a plea for help; even the smallest support for the army could instill more hope. Please, we need your help.
